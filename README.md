# Kotlin ConcurrentModificationException Example

This repository demonstrates the `ConcurrentModificationException` in Kotlin when modifying a collection (like ArrayList) while iterating over it using a `for` loop or similar constructs. It also shows safe ways to avoid this exception.

The `bug.kt` file contains code that will throw the exception.  The `bugSolution.kt` file provides corrected versions that use safer iteration techniques.

## How to run

1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Open the project in your favorite Kotlin IDE (IntelliJ IDEA is recommended).
3.  Run the `bug.kt` file to observe the exception.
4.  Run the `bugSolution.kt` file to see how to avoid the exception.
